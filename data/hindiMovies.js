When DON gets seriously injured in a police encounter, the word that he is dead begins to do the rounds. The reality, of course, is that DON is held captive in a secret location, while his bumpkin of a look-alike, Vijay, is polished and sent to infiltrate DON's gang. In a bizarre twist of fate, when the policeman shielding the humble street singer Vijay, is killed, the latter comes to terms with the horrifying realization that both the police and the gang are out to get him for different reasons. In a desperate attempt to prove his innocence, he is aided by the glamorous Roma (Priyanka Chopra), and ex-con Jasjit (Arjun Rampal), who owes Vijay a debt for caring for his son during his imprisonment.

Without a drop of rain in months, the worried villagers of Champaner decide to ask the local authorities for a temporary repeal of their taxes -- the hated lagaan. Led by the heroic Bhuvan (Indian superstar Aamir Khan) they bring their plight to the military governor, Captain Russell (Paul Blackthorne). But the sadistic Russell threatens to raise the lagaan threefold, unless the villagers can beat his men at a game of cricket, in which case he'll lift taxes on the entire province for a period of three years. Bhuvan accepts the challenge, but there's a problem -- no one in Champaner knows how to play cricket. A band of misfits come to the rescue, coached by Russell's soft-hearted sister Elizabeth (Rachel Shelley), and the race is on to be ready in three months' time.

It spans a few genres; it is slick, fast-paced, realistic and, importantly, very funny.In this \"smart comedy\" set in 1999, all the characters are found by a common feeling of being stuck at 99 in life - just one short of a 'century' - that elusive thing called \"making it\" in life!99 is an unpredictable and hilarious ride spread over two cities with colorful characters, unbelievable circumstances, small-time crooks, big-time conspiracies, fateful car crashes, loads of coffee, a briefcase full of money, a budding romance....... And a historical controversy brewing in the background!","posterUrl":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/cvhM9kk26zkVGUrd147aITrx2qi.jpg","productionCompanies":"[{'name': 'People Pictures', 'id': 3694}]","productionCountries":"[{'iso_3166_1': 'IN', 'name': 'India'}]","releaseDate":"2009-05-15","runtimeMinutes":141,"spokenLanguages":"[{'iso_639_1': 'hi', 'name': 'हिन्दी'}]","status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"99","cast":[{"castId":1,"character":"Sachin","creditId":"52fe47ff9251416c750ac73f","gender":2,"id":85454,"name":"Kunal Khemu","order":0,"profilePath":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/vuCBNPmNqul4oBeHZS7bVS2fPPB.jpg"},{"castId":2,"character":"Rahul","creditId":"52fe47ff9251416c750ac743","gender":2,"id":35779,"name":"Boman Irani","order":1,"profilePath":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/ybhFam8adUpWz3Re49T8uDm8DcT.jpg"},{"castId":3,"character":"Pooja","creditId":"52fe47ff9251416c750ac747","gender":1,"id":53672,"name":"Soha Ali Khan","order":2,"profilePath":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/qKrJ8DMYPEEKm948JiruG2rXTOE.jpg"},{"castId":4,"character":"Zaramud","creditId":"52fe47ff9251416c750ac74b","gender":0,"id":85455,"name":"Cyrus Broacha","order":3,"profilePath":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/h9rrVIxGcQDQeftO5vZvrYBBpxm.jpg"},{"castId":5,"character":"Jahnavi","creditId":"52fe47ff9251416c750ac74f","gender":0,"id":35755,"name":"Simone Singh","order":4,"profilePath":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/w3Cg7DmIyoedLciqfw04AFmsHin.jpg"},{"castId":6,"character":"AGM","creditId":"52fe47ff9251416c750ac753","gender":0,"id":85456,"name":"Mahesh Manjrekar","order":5,"profilePath":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/rAAlncxpCKpXjUHsd6pfaSaTl96.jpg"},{"castId":7,"character":"Kuber","creditId":"52fe47ff9251416c750ac757","gender":0,"id":85457,"name":"Amit Mistry","order":6,"profilePath":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/ax8kArrS3rHmCszt79UtqR46OYm.jpg"},{"castId":8,"character":"JC","creditId":"52fe47ff9251416c750ac75b","gender":2,"id":85458,"name":"Vinod Khanna","order":7,"profilePath":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/hREM82FT7u8QVXRdwNz0FTiNipA.jpg"},{"castId":9,"character":"Sunil Mehta","creditId":"52fe47ff9251416c750ac75f","gender":2,"id":85459,"name":"Sudesh Berry","order":8,"profilePath":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/AaJlSFAmFJpvMG2EDDzfoi6EYir.jpg"}]},{"tmdbId":"20002","genres":[{"id":28,"name":"Action"},{"id":12,"name":"Adventure"},{"id":35,"name":"Comedy"},{"id":18,"name":"Drama"}],"originalLanguage":"hi","originalTitle":"Chandni Chowk To China","overview":"Based in Delhi's Chandni Chowk, orphaned Sidhu is adopted by the owner of Bajrang Bali Parathas, known simply as Dada.
